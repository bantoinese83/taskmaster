## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Database Configuration
TaskMaster uses Prisma with a default SQLite database for development. For production, we recommend using PostgreSQL or MySQL. Update your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file and run migrations accordingly.

### Authentication Options
By default, TaskMaster uses NextAuth.js with a credentials provider. You can add additional providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) by updating the `lib/auth.ts` file.

### Deployment
TaskMaster is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and configure the environment variables.
